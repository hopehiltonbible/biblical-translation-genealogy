  key_message: |
    Romans 8:38‑39 lists every conceivable obstacle—life, death, time, powers and
    the whole of creation—and declares that none of them can separate us from
    God’s love.  Each translation underscores the absolute security of divine
    love in Christ.

    For those feeling condemned or abandoned, these verses insist that no
    circumstance, identity or action can cut you off from God’s love.  If you
    worry that your orientation separates you from God, Romans 8 reminds you
    that nothing in all creation can pry you from God’s embrace.
