  key_message: |
    Isaiah 43:1‑4 reassures the people that God has created, redeemed and
    personally called them.  God promises to be with them through deep waters
    and fire, calling them by name and declaring them precious and loved.

    This passage speaks directly to fear and shame.  God says “You are mine” and
    “I love you” to those who feel outcast or unworthy.  It affirms that you
    are precious in God’s sight and that divine presence accompanies you through
    every trial.  For queer youth, Isaiah 43 is a reminder that God’s love and
    protection are unwavering, no matter what others say.
