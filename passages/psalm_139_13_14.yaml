    When queer youth or anyone else questions their worth, Psalm 139:13‑14 offers
    a reminder that your existence is not an accident.  You are lovingly formed
    and wonderfully made, no matter what others say about your identity or
    orientation.  God’s craftsmanship includes you, and nothing can negate the
    value placed on your life by the Creator.
