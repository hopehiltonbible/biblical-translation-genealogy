    notes: "The Message flattens the chapter structure into a continuous narrative, making the rhetorical trap obvious by turning Paul's 'Therefore' into a clear admonition against finger‑pointing."
  life_saving_insight: "Across translations, Romans 1:26‑27 lists behaviours that many modern readers see as condemnations of same‑sex conduct.  Yet the Greek conjunction Διὸ (“therefore”) at the start of Romans 2:1 connects that list to Paul’s larger argument.  He is ventriloquizing the judgmental voice in chapter 1 only to turn the accusation back on those who judge.  Reading Romans 1 and 2 as a unit shifts the focus from condemning others to examining our own complicity.  This perspective can be life‑giving for queer readers, reminding them that Paul's point is not that God despises them, but that God condemns judgmentalism."
