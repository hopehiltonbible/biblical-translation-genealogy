# Schema for individual Bible translation entries
#
# This YAML schema specifies the structure of files in the
# `translations/` directory.  It uses a simplified schema
# notation inspired by JSON Schema but adapted for YAML.  The
# schema is not enforced automatically in this repository; it
# serves as documentation for contributors and downstream tools.
