# Sources:
# - The Great Bible (1539) was produced under Miles Coverdale and drew heavily on William Tyndale’s English New Testament and John Rogers’ Matthew’s Bible.  It became the first English Bible authorised for use in the Church of England【285709022419918†L45-L51】.
# - As the Great Bible reprints Tyndale’s wording, its rendering of John 3:16 follows the same line as other early modern versions: “For God so loued the worlde, that he gaue his only begotten sonne, that whosoever beleueth in hym shoulde not perishe, but haue everlasting life”【256561450741269†L122-L123】.
