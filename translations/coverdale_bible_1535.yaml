# Sources:
# - Coverdale’s Bible (1535) was the first complete English Bible in print; Miles Coverdale drew heavily on Tyndale’s New Testament and Pentateuch, the Zürich (Zwingli) German Bible, the Latin Vulgate and Luther’s German translation.  He worked with little knowledge of Greek or Hebrew, instead using existing vernacular and Latin versions【252135726227942†L30-L37】.
# - John 3:16 in the Coverdale Bible reads: “For God so loued the worlde, that he gaue his onely sonne, that who so euer beleueth in hi, shulde not perishe, but haue euerlasting life”【256561450741269†L125-L127】.
