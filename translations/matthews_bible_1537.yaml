# Sources:
# - Matthew’s Bible (1537) combined William Tyndale’s New Testament and Pentateuch with Myles Coverdale’s translations for the rest of the Old Testament and the Apocrypha.  The historical books (Joshua through 2 Chronicles) may represent Tyndale’s unpublished translation; John Rogers edited the volume under the pseudonym “Thomas Matthew”【330106584528311†L18-L33】.
# - Because the Matthew’s Bible reproduces Tyndale’s New Testament almost verbatim, John 3:16 mirrors Tyndale’s wording: “For God so loveth the worlde yt he hath geven his only sonne that none that beleve in him shuld perisshe: but shuld have everlastinge lyfe”【256561450741269†L125-L131】.
