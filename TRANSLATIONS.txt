Biblical Translation Guide
This repository catalogues a broad family of English Bible translations. Each translation is represented as a YAML file under the translations/ directory. The project captures more than publication dates: it records sample text (John 3:16), the primary source texts consulted, the relationships to other translations, and a five‑dimensional description of translation philosophy.

Translation philosophy framework
Traditional labels like formal and dynamic are helpful but often hide the trade‑offs translators make. This guide uses five axes to describe how a translation handles the delicate balance between fidelity and clarity:

Axis	High	Low
word‑for‑word	Stays close to individual words and their order	Freely departs from word‑level rendering
sentence‑for‑sentence	Preserves sentence structure and boundary	Merges or recasts sentences for readability
passage‑for‑passage	Follows the flow of longer units	Reorders or summarises passages
idea‑for‑idea	Conveys the thought even if wording changes	Prioritises literal wording over modern phrasing
syntax‑for‑syntax	Retains grammatical form (e.g. verb tenses, clauses)	Replaces structure with target‑language equivalents
Values of high, medium and low (or occasionally low, moderate, high depending on the file) in the translation files indicate a relative emphasis along each axis when compared to other translations. For example, the King James Version has high word_for_word and syntax_for_syntax values but low idea_for_idea because it prioritises literal wording and structure over modern idiom.

# Schema for individual Bible translation entries
#
# This YAML schema specifies the structure of files in the
# `translations/` directory.  It uses a simplified schema
# notation inspired by JSON Schema but adapted for YAML.  The
# schema is not enforced automatically in this repository; it
# serves as documentation for contributors and downstream tools.

# Sources:
# - The Great Bible (1539) was produced under Miles Coverdale and drew heavily on William Tyndale’s English New Testament and John Rogers’ Matthew’s Bible.  It became the first English Bible authorised for use in the Church of England【285709022419918†L45-L51】.
# - As the Great Bible reprints Tyndale’s wording, its rendering of John 3:16 follows the same line as other early modern versions: “For God so loued the worlde, that he gaue his only begotten sonne, that whosoever beleueth in hym shoulde not perishe, but haue everlasting life”【256561450741269†L122-L123】.

# Sources:
# - Matthew’s Bible (1537) combined William Tyndale’s New Testament and Pentateuch with Myles Coverdale’s translations for the rest of the Old Testament and the Apocrypha.  The historical books (Joshua through 2 Chronicles) may represent Tyndale’s unpublished translation; John Rogers edited the volume under the pseudonym “Thomas Matthew”【330106584528311†L18-L33】.
# - Because the Matthew’s Bible reproduces Tyndale’s New Testament almost verbatim, John 3:16 mirrors Tyndale’s wording: “For God so loveth the worlde yt he hath geven his only sonne that none that beleve in him shuld perisshe: but shuld have everlastinge lyfe”【256561450741269†L125-L131】.

    text: "Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you… because you are precious in my eyes, and honored, and I love you."
  niv:
    text: "Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you… Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you."

    text: "Don't be afraid, I've redeemed you. I've called your name. You're mine. When you're in over your head, I'll be there… That's how much you mean to me! That's how much I love you!"
  key_message: |
    Isaiah 43:1‑4 reassures the people that God has created, redeemed and
    personally called them.  God promises to be with them through deep waters
    and fire, calling them by name and declaring them precious and loved.
  life_saving_insight: |
    This passage speaks directly to fear and shame.  God says “You are mine” and
    “I love you” to those who feel outcast or unworthy.  It affirms that you
    are precious in God’s sight and that divine presence accompanies you through
    every trial.  For queer youth, Isaiah 43 is a reminder that God’s love and
    protection are unwavering, no matter what others say.

  niv:
    text: "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
  the_message:
    text: "I know what I'm doing. I have it all planned out—plans to take care of you, not abandon you, plans to give you the future you hope for."
  key_message: |
    Jeremiah 29:11 conveys God’s assurance to exiles that their future is held in
    divine hands.  The plans God has are for welfare, hope and a good future,
    not harm.  Every translation emphasises that God intends good for those who
    are despairing.
  life_saving_insight: |
    When life feels hopeless, Jeremiah 29:11 offers a promise that God’s plans
    include hope and a future.  For queer youth struggling under rejection,
    this passage assures them that God’s intentions are to prosper and care for
    them—not to harm or abandon them.  There is a future and a hope beyond the
    present pain.

  the_message:
    text: "Oh yes, you shaped me first inside, then out; you formed me in my mother's womb. I thank you, High God—you're breathtaking! Body and soul, I am marvelously made!"
  key_message: |
    Psalm 139 celebrates God’s intimate knowledge and creative involvement in our
    lives.  Across translations, the psalmist affirms that each person is
    fearfully and wonderfully made—lovingly knit together with care and purpose.
  life_saving_insight: |
    When queer youth or anyone else questions their worth, Psalm 139:13‑14 offers
    a reminder that your existence is not an accident.  You are lovingly formed
    and wonderfully made, no matter what others say about your identity or
    orientation.  God’s craftsmanship includes you, and nothing can negate the
    value placed on your life by the Creator.

    notes: "The Message flattens the chapter structure into a continuous narrative, making the rhetorical trap obvious by turning Paul's 'Therefore' into a clear admonition against finger‑pointing."
  life_saving_insight: "Across translations, Romans 1:26‑27 lists behaviours that many modern readers see as condemnations of same‑sex conduct.  Yet the Greek conjunction Διὸ (“therefore”) at the start of Romans 2:1 connects that list to Paul’s larger argument.  He is ventriloquizing the judgmental voice in chapter 1 only to turn the accusation back on those who judge.  Reading Romans 1 and 2 as a unit shifts the focus from condemning others to examining our own complicity.  This perspective can be life‑giving for queer readers, reminding them that Paul's point is not that God despises them, but that God condemns judgmentalism."


romans_8_38_39:

    text: "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither the present nor the future, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
  the_message:
    text: "I'm absolutely convinced that nothing—nothing living or dead, today or tomorrow—can get between us and God's love because of the way that Jesus our Master has embraced us."
  key_message: |
    Romans 8:38‑39 lists every conceivable obstacle—life, death, time, powers and
    the whole of creation—and declares that none of them can separate us from
    God’s love.  Each translation underscores the absolute security of divine
    love in Christ.
  life_saving_insight: |
    For those feeling condemned or abandoned, these verses insist that no
    circumstance, identity or action can cut you off from God’s love.  If you
    worry that your orientation separates you from God, Romans 8 reminds you
    that nothing in all creation can pry you from God’s embrace.
